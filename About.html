				<p>I was born in Bremerton, WA, but I grew up in Charlotte, NC. I attended Harding University High School and Phillip'O'Berry Academy of Technology before going off to the University of Alabama for computer science. I earned a few credits while attending the University, but ended up coming back home to Charlotte to continue my postsecondary education. I still study Computer Science, which takes form in many hobbies, one of which is webpage design.
