				<p>Hey! I'm Israel. I am a fledgling web developer, game designer and artist with hopes of doing it all for a living some day. I currently practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript in my freetime and write simple webpages with some pretty cool sketches, too. Although the layouts to my pages are basic, I make it important to implement the fundamentals of web development into each page I create. I am also beginning to create simple games with javascript, with some difficulty.</p> 
				<p>But enought about me, feel free to explore the site and please contact me if you would like to get in touch!</p>
